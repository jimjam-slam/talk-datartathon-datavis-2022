TODO - notes
:::

1. Why talk to mass media?
  - Polarisation 
  - Non-persuasive communication
  - Big audiences
2. Graphics for broadcast
  - Alternatives: newspaper, online, podcasts, etc (but we'll focus on broadcast)
  - People involved in broadcast:
    - Presenter
    - News editor
    - 
    -

I've been working at 360info for about 9 months

We're a research-driven newswire, and we give everything away for free under Creative Commons so that all journalists can benefit from it

Part of my role is creating our visuals. (click)

That means I do everything: coding, design and analysis.

As our team grows, I'm also working with our infrastructure partners and looking for ways to make it easier for reporters and editors to use our charts

One reason is we live in a world where it's easier than ever for people to seek out their own news.

That's not always a bad thing! Australia has a very concentrated media market, and that has real downsides around monopoly power information quality.

But there are downsides too - one of which being that people are less likely to receive the same information.

## Trust {.text-orange-gold}

::: {.notes}
The good news is that researchers are still really trusted - much more so than other figures - in many fields.

This survey looked at who people trust for news about climate change. The standout source is researchers and scientists, trusted by half the audience.

You don't have to use TV! There are other opportunities to get a message out to large audiences, even once we rule out the smaller, more fragmented things like social media.

The other visual media are newspapers and digital. But these are very different to TV.

What's the difference between these two stories?
